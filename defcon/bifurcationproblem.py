        This method allows the user to compute whether a solution on a given branch is
        stable.

        Stability means different things to different problems. For example, in an unconstrained
        energy minimisation problem, investigating stability involves checking the positive
        definiteness of the Hessian at a critical point; in constrained minimisation, one needs
        to check the inertia of the Hessian and verify that the number of negative eigenvalues
        is as expected, given the constraints.

        With this in mind, defcon does not attempt to compute the stability of solutions;
        it just provides a hook for you to calculate whatever test you wish.

        It is often the case that some results from one stability analysis can be used
        to accelerate the calculation of the next. For example, in SLEPc one can
        set an initial guess for the eigenspace, and if it is a good guess the algorithms
        converge much faster. This is the purpose of the hint input. For the first
        calculation on a given branch, it is None, but on subsequent calculations it
        is passed along from the outputs of one calculation to the inputs of the next.

        This routine should return the following: a dictionary like

        d = {"stable": is_stable,
             "eigenvalues":    [list of eigenvalues],
             "eigenfunctions": [list of eigenfunctions],
             "hint": hint}

        is_stable can be anything that can be evaluated with literal_eval in Python.
        Its value has meaning only to you. The reason why this is not True/False
        is because stability is more subtle than that -- for example, one could
        pass None to indicate that the computation failed. In other problems
        (such as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in quantum mechanics) there are
        different ways a problem can be unstable; these could be distinguished
        by returning "exponential" or "oscillatory".

        eigenvalues is a list of real or complex numbers. These will be saved
        by the I/O object. The list can be empty.

        eigenfunctions is a list of Functions. These will also be saved by
        the I/O object. Again, the list can be empty.

        hint is any data that you wish to pass on to the next calculation.

        In UFL, one cannot split or differentiate a form with respect to the
        output of split. This is a problem for us when we do arclength continuation,
        as I need to re-use the user's residual in a bigger system for state x parameter.
        However, if the user's code uses split or derivative (quite reasonable and
        common things to do), this breaks.

        When the arclength code is calculating the state residual, it first tries to
        call BifurcationProblem.residual on the state component of the bigger mixed
        function space; if that fails, it calls this, on the _entire_ arclength
        state and test functions. This means that one can do something like

        def residual(self, u, params, v):
            # Normal state residual
            Energy = self.energy(u, params)
            L = derivative(Energy, u, v)

            return L

        def ac_residual(self, ac, params, w):
            # State residual for use in arclength calculation
            (u, _) = split(ac)
            Energy = self.energy(u, params)
            L = derivative(Energy, ac, w)

            return L

        to take the derivative with respect to the whole function instead of the original
        split state.

        *Arguments*
          state (:py:class:`dolfin.Function`)
            a Function in the FunctionSpace
          params (tuple of :py:class:`dolfin.Constant`)
            the parameters to use, in the same order returned by parameters()
          test  (:py:class:`dolfin.TestFunction`)
            the test function to use in defining the residual
        *Returns*
          residual (:py:class:`ufl.form.Form`)
            the form for the residual
