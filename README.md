## Synopsis

The defcon library implements the deflated continuation algorithm of
Farrell, Beentjes and Birkisson. Its objective is to compute the
solutions of

f(u, λ) = 0,

where u is the solution of a PDE and λ is a parameter on which the PDE
depends.

The algorithm that defcon implements has two main advantages over the
previous state of the art:

* Defcon can compute disconnected bifurcation diagrams as well as connected
  ones.
* The algorithm can scale to massive discretisations of PDEs if a scalable
  preconditioner is available.

For a full description of the algorithm, see

http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00809

## Dependencies

Defcon can be used either with Firedrake (http://firedrakeproject.org)
or FEniCS (http://fenicsproject.org). FEniCS-X is not yet supported.
Development now mainly occurs with Firedrake.

If you're compiling FEniCS yourself, you'll need

* mpi4py (http://pythonhosted.org/mpi4py/)
* petsc4py (https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py)
* FEniCS, compiled with PETSc, petsc4py and HDF5 support (http://fenicsproject.org)

Defcon recommends (and some of the examples depend on)

* h5py, compiled against parallel HDF5 (http://www.h5py.org/)
* matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org, for rendering bifurcation diagrams)
* mshr (https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/mshr)
* slepc4py (https://bitbucket.org/slepc/slepc4py, for computing stabilities)
* PyQT5/PyQT4 (https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro, for the GUI)
* latex (https://www.tug.org/texlive/, for rendering TeX strings in the GUI)

## Current status and automated testing

Defcon is automatically tested against a development version of Firedrake,
using Bitbucket Pipelines and CircleCI. This ensures that defcon
should always run with a recent Firedrake development version.

[![Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/defcon/downloads/status.svg)](https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/defcon/addon/pipelines/home)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/bb/pefarrell/defcon.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/bb/pefarrell/defcon)

To run the tests yourself, do

    mpiexec -n 2 py.test -x -v examples/firedrake

when everything is installed.

## Code Examples

The easiest way to learn how to use it is to examine the examples in
`examples/`. Start with `examples/firedrake/elastica` or `examples/fenics/elastica`,
and compare to the Euler elastica section of the manuscript cited above.

## Installation

    pip install -e .

## Use in anaconda environments with FEniCS

Here is an example of how to use defcon with anaconda and FEniCS:

    # Install FEniCS
    conda create -n fenicsproject -c conda-forge fenics
    source activate fenicsproject

    # Install other dependencies
    conda install scipy
    pip install h5py # conda-supplied h5py is incompatible with FEniCS
    pip install https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py/get/master.tar.gz
    conda install matplotlib scipy ipython pyqt

    # Install defcon
    cd /path/to/defcon
    pip install -e .

    # Try it out
    cd examples/fenics/wingedcusp
    mpiexec -n 2 python wingedcusp.py
    defcon gui

## The official defcon Docker container

A Docker container for defcon is generated weekly as part of the CI
pipeline. This container comes with the Firedrake backend.

The defcon Docker image can be run locally on a machine with Docker
installed by executing:

    docker run -it jdbetteridge/defcon

Each month a release is created and a specific release can be selected
by adding the tag to the image name eg: `jdbetteridge/defcon:2023-04`
will use defcon from April 2023.

Inside the iamge defcon is installed in the
`/home/firedrake/firedrake/src/defcon` directory. To run an example
first activate the Firedrake virtual environment by executing:

    source /home/firedrake/firedrake/bin/activate

The Bratu example can be run in the activated environment by executing:

    cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/defcon/examples/firedrake/bratu
    mpiexec -n 2 python bratu.py

## Use in FEniCS Docker containers

FEniCS Docker containers introduce a convenient way of distributing FEniCS on
many platforms, see

http://fenics-containers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html .

To use defcon in a FEniCS docker container, simply fire up a container with
development version of FEniCS, e.g. using `fenicsproject run dev`, and in the
container type

    CC=mpicc HDF5_MPI=ON pip3 install --no-binary=h5py --no-cache-dir --user h5py
    pip3 install --user https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/defcon/get/master.tar.gz

Then you can navigate to defcon demos and run them

    cd /home/fenics/.local/share/defcon/examples/fenics/elastica
    mpirun -n 2 python3 elastica.py

## Running the GUI in docker

To use the defcon GUI, a much more complicated procedure is needed.
We suggest installing FEniCS via anaconda as described above, instead.
However, if you're very keen on GUIs + docker, here are some notes.

### Connecting X11 applications on Linux
One needs to allow a docker container to connect to host's X11 system:

    xhost +
    docker run -ti -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix quay.io/fenicsproject/dev

or another docker image in place of quay.io/fenicsproject/dev.
Don't forget to run `xhost -` when finished with the container.

### Running the GUI in docker on OSX
If running on OSX, you need to have the appropriate XQuartz program running, and to
convince it to talk to the GUI in docker. To do so, perform the following steps:

* Run XQuartz
* Go to Preferences > 'Security' tab; turn on 'Allow connection from network clients'
* Restart XQuartz
* Get your local machine's IP:

        ip=$(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}') && echo "My IP is: $ip"

* Allow the local machine to talk to XQuartz and run the docker container:

        xhost + ${ip}
        docker run -ti -e DISPLAY=${ip}:0 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix quay.io/fenicsproject/dev /bin/bash

  or another docker image in place of quay.io/fenicsproject/dev.

Don't forget to run `xhost -` when finished with the container.

### Running the GUI in the FEniCS-supplied images
In the container one needs to install latex and one of PyQt5, PyQt4, or PySide.
The most convenient is

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3-pyqt5 dvipng texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended

After installing h5py and defcon as described above, one can run the gui and
start a defcon application by

    cd /home/fenics/.local/share/defcon/examples/fenics/elastica
    export QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM=native # may not be necessary on all systems
    defcon gui &
    mpirun -n 2 python3 elastica.py

Note that only aspects of FEniCS docker containers directly related to defcon
have been shown. To setup a practical workflow (allowing preservation of JIT
cache, etc.), we recommend the FEniCS Docker manual, at

http://fenics-containers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html .

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure all mesh constructors, `Expressions` and `CompiledSubDomains` take
  in the MPI communicator (see e.g. `examples/fenics/navier-stokes`). This is the most common cause of silent
  deadlocks.
